# TimeSHAP
TimeSHAP issue page: https://github.com/feedzai/timeshap/issues/12

Two identical python files but different transormation functions are used:
- mock_example_ts_use_case.ipynb -> same transformation as AReM case - TimeSHAP works
- mock_example_my_use_case.ipynb -> transformation required for the desired use case (described on the issue page, TimeSHAP doesn't work)
